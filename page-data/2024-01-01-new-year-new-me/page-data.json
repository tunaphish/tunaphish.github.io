It is New Year's Day and I am at the end of my lease on the last week of my job that I have been at for the last 4 1/2 years. In a couple weeks Rena and I drive back to Florida and a few weeks after that we move into our new house.</p>\n<p>By all accounts I have an incredibly fortunate life in the three ways it probably counts the most; my partner, my finances, my health. The body, resources, and support required to pretty much do anything I wanted. But I did not do the things I wanted. The work I was doing was no longer satisfying and the lack of energy it left for me after work resulted in me just going on my phone and playing Apex. All day I lived a life of no meaning.</p>\n<p>I initially moved here because of that feeling of dissatisfaction. And overall it was a failure. But from that failure I gained the perspective I needed to take advantage of the new opportunities in front of me. The biggest lesson, is that meaning is self generated. And I want all of it... all the meaning. Everything life has to offer.</p>\n<p>I want to be fit. I want to learn things I am passionate about. I want to connect with others, in a home and circles of my own cultivation. I want to luxuriate in life itself, in the moment itself. And I want to express myself through my art.</p>\n<h2>2024</h2>\n<p>Differentiation and Integration. Here are some goals for the year.
