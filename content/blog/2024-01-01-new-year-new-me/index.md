For a while now, I have felt dissatisfied with my life. It is New Year's Day and I am at the end of my lease on the last week of my job that I have been at for the last 4 1/2 years. In a couple weeks Rena and I drive back to Florida and a few weeks after that we move into our new house.

By all accounts I have an incredibly fortunate life in the three ways it probably counts the most; my partner, my finances, my health. The body, resources, and support required to pretty much do anything I wanted. But I did not do the things I wanted. The work I was doing was no longer satisfying and the lack of energy it left for me after work resulted in me just going on my phone and playing Apex. All day I lived a life of no meaning. 

I initially moved here because of that feeling of dissatisfaction. And overall it was a failure. But from that failure I gained the perspective I needed to take advantage of the new opportunities in front of me. The biggest lesson, is that meaning is self generated. And I want all of it... all the meaning. Everything life has to offer. 

I want to be fit. I want to learn things I am passionate about. I want to connect with others, in a home and circles of my own cultivation. I want to luxuriate in life itself, in the moment itself. And I want to express myself through my art.
