I edited this video over a year ago. Never posted it. 
I didn't realize the meaning it would have for me until now.

Just a stupid night in our living room. We were treating our bedroom for ants and couldn't stay in there. Rena thought it was going to be a bad night, so I setup a "fort" and had a sleepover with the dogs. 

I still felt like a child back then. Just drifting along. So much changed in just a couple years. I had "five year plans" that feel so tenuous now. 
Careers. Money. None of that shit even matters.

The best thing in life is coming home to your dog, all excited to see you, and going on a walk with them. Maybe there's even a cool breeeze.
